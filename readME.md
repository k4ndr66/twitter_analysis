Welcome to my Twitter Sentiment Analysis program!

In order to run the code from **main_file.ipynb** you need to download following files:
- [database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
- [TFIDF-Vectorizer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/view?resourcekey=0-wjGZdNAUop6WykTtMip30g)
- [Glove](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thanakomsn/glove6b300dtxt)

...and then put them all in a folder with main file. If you need any help, feel free to ask!

> (Unfortunately, I couldn't upload them to github, since they're too big)
